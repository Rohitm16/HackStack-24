hi
This is just a simple webpage made using React framwork, i have added toadtify , react-icons and used useState , Axions to make it work .
The Error hanlding is working fine and the look is very simple.
If i gets time i will add little bit of more styling to it and will make some changes to it
It may be possible that Network Error appears on your screen , as while making it i have already exceed the request limit from Accuweather,
in this case you can change the API_Key from someone else and try it.
